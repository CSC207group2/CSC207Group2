This project acts as an app to plan trips with. From the app, a user can look for and save flights, save countries, look up country information, and check the weather.
This project allows the user to have a centralized hub for trip planning without having to switch through multiple apps, and serves to organize trip details.

# Features
## Flight Saving
A user may look up flights from one airport to the other, by using airport codes. Once these codes have been looked up, they can then be saved to an external database that the user can access while logged in at any time.

## Country Info
Additionally, a user may want to look up information about a country, such as their currency and native language. This information can also be saved and accessed later.

## Weather
If a user wishes to look for the weather, they can use the weather portion of the app, which allows them to view the high and low temperatures for up to 300 days in the future.

## AI Overview
A user may also want to know some general info about the country or city they are visiting. They are able to speak to an AI chatbot which will give them useful insights on the location like tourist attractions, while also warning them of common scams and traps they may encounter.
