# Equitable Use
The software allows people to easily search for information about countries. 
However, steps could be taken to make it more accessible. For example, a language 
selection menu could allow for users of diverse backgrounds to use this app.

# Flexibility in Use


# Simple and Intuitive Use
The software is relatively simple to use, with everything being labeled and 
straight-forward. However, text fields may be a bit difficult to understand. Given 
more time, developing an autofill system would likely mitigate this issue

# Perceptible Information
The design communicates info to the user clearly. The UI is simple and straight 
forward, allowing for the user to immediately understand the information presented 
to them.

# Tolerance for Error
There are many safeguards in place for errors. For example, the weather app 
will inform the user if an error in date is selected, or if an invalid location 
is selected. 

# Low Physical Effort
While the program lessens the negligible physical toll of switching apps, this 
principle does not apply to our project. Operating this app is not physically 
demanding. Perhaps if someone is unable to use their arms, a voice recognition system 
could be implemented.

# Size and Space
As our project is an app, this principle does not apply. This principle applies 
more to physical objects, such as physical products or architectural features.

# Target Demographic
This product is likely to be used by people who travel a lot. For example, 
someone going on vacation could use this product to plan a trip effectively. 
Alternatively, a businessman planning a business trip could also use this app. 

# Less Likely Demographics
People without reliable internet or modern devices may struggle to 
access features like flight searches or weather updates. Additionally,
Older adults or users with lower digital literacy might find the 
app harder to navigate.
